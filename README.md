## How it works

The algorithm currently uses these techniques to rank documents. (in this order)

- Inverted Index
- Cosine similarity
-  Word proximity
- Title weight (If the title includes a query term it is rated higher)

When retrieving relevent documents,

And uses a simple `LIKE` sql statement in [all_dialogues](https://github.com/Tharusha-dev/WANsearch/blob/main/WANsearchAPI/db/README.md) table for quoted search.
